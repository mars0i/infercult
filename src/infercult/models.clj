;; FIXME DOESN'T WORK
;; Intended to allow iterating next-freq-2
;; e.g. like this:
;; (double-cross-iterate (partial next-freq-2 0.5 0.2 0.8) (partial next-freq-2 0.5 0.8 0.2)  [0.5 0.4]))

     [x y], [(f x y) (g y x)], 
     [(f (f x y) (g y x))
      (g (g y x) (f x y))], etc.
  i.e. at each step, takes the result [x y] from the previous step and 
  generates [x' y'] by applying f to x and y, and g to the same values 
  in reverse order."
